Cellphones dashboard
In this project I made a simple dashboard for a small database about cellphone.

#### Database Schema

This database consisted of 3 tables called cellphones data, cellphones rating and cellphones users.
This database only had two connections.

#### Dashboard

The dashboard was created following the criteria:

-Relationship between average rating and release date.
-Top 5 best cellphone models rated by women
-Prices per brand
-Relationship between ocupation and cellphone model
-Average rating per gender per ocupation

1.Date are better explained using lines. 
2.Top 5 should be presented as a table.
3. I selected prices per brand as a column graphic, but it could be a table. 
4. I created a filter to explore the rest of graphics acording to occupation.
5. I created a table to display average rating per gender.
